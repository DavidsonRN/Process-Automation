Some GIT helps

To bring in changes from the main into your dev branch
1. commit everything clean
2. switch to dev branch
3. open shell
4. type: git rebase main

=======
Dave and Tom can both work on main for right now

Another workflow can be to work on dev and then when dev looks good it can merge to main with a pull request on github
